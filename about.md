## What's up, journo-hacker wannabe?
I have been working as a freelance journalist for quite some time. I specialize in science, environment and nature since I have a master degree in both biology and science journalism. 

So why learn web development and programming? Well, for one thing I think many stories that needs to be told today means that I as a journalist needs to be able to handle a LOT of data. 

I think that programming is an excellent tool to help reveal those stories as well as tell the stories. I think there is a lot of creative stuff to do in telling stories with the web as a medium. And I want to work with that - on the border between tech, art and journalism.

In case there is some spare time, I still run my company, I make music with homemade electronic instruments and photograph stuff in nature. Thats how this journo-hacker wannabe rolls.
