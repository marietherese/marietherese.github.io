## What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

To add a text-file in the root-directory named humans.txt is to follow a initiative to make a standard on how to give information about authorship of a site and give credentials to all the people involved in the making of a website.

To do it with this text-file is non intrusive to the site and code and a very easy way to give all the extra information to those who wants it. 


In this site I added a humans.txt file and a little humansTXT button in the footer. The button makes it easy to find the text-file that includes some information about me, the site and what tools I used to create the site.
