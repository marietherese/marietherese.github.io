What is robots.txt and how did I make use of it in this site?

Robots.txt is a file in the root of the site directory that have instructions for how to handle robots.
Robots might be crawlers from search engines indexing your site. But robots are all type of automated programs that searches the web for different kinds of informatione and documents. Robotot that searches for email-adresses to spam for exemple.

The robot.txt file give instructions to robots about things like if they are welcome and what files and directories they might look into. It is important to remember though that robots might just not give a crap about your instructions. It is merely instructions to those robots who got instructions from there human creators that they should care about robot.txt-files.

On this site i wrote a robot.txt file that instructed crawlers from the search-engines google, yahoo and duck duck go to look into the files and directories that actually constitutes the website and directoies like those for images, assets and such I asked the robots not to look into.
