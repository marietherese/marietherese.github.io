## What do you think of static site generators?
For this site I used the static site generator Jekyll which was easy to install in Linux Mint and was very quick to get started with. I took a little more effort to get a good grip on the file structure and to start to modify the page with more pages and a different look.

But it was fairly straight forward and, once I got the hang of the file structure and scss-files, I think its a very good way to quickly be doing the more interesting stuff with the content and presentation.

## What type of projects are they suitable for?
Static site generators are good for sites where you don't need to be handling different accounts, log ins and other more complex functionality. When you need a straight forward presentation and a simple blog functionality - static sites are very safe and saves you time. 

Jekylls out-of-the-box compatibility with git hub makes it also very quick to update.
