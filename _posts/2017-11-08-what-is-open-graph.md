## What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?

Open graph is a protocol for making links look nice and have functionality when being shared in social media. For example showing a image, being able to play a video or audio clip.

Essentially its all about adding some lines of meta data to the head of the website. In these lines of meta data it is specified some properties of the graph object that will be presented.  

This is the meta data I provided for the open graph protocol in this site:

`<meta property="og:title" content="The life of a journo-hacker wannabe" />`

`<meta property="og:type" content="website" />`

`<meta property="og:url" content="https://marietherese.github.io/" />`

`<meta property="og:image" content="./img/asp.jpg" />`
